            <h2>‘Pennyworth’ Could Move From Epix to HBO Max</h2>
            <p>Pennyworth, the prequel series focusing on DC Comics character Alfred Pennyworth's pre-butler exploits as a British SAS agent, could be moved from Epix to HBO Max, where it currently airs. Negotiations are currently underway, and you can read more about them below. According to Deadline, Epix and Warner Bros. TV are in talks to renew Pennyworth for a third season.There is yet to be any news about whether a third season could be revealed. Epix, Warner Bros. TV, and HBO Max have declined to comment on the extension or any potential changes in distribution.
All of the original DC Universe episodes, including Doom Patrol, Titans, and Harley Quinn, are currently available on HBO Max. With several original projects in the works, such as Peacemaker, a Gotham City police series, and Green Lantern, getting Pennyworth into the fold is a no-brainer.The series follows Alfred Pennyworth (Jack Bannon), a former British SAS soldier in his twenties who, before becoming Bruce Wayne's butler, establishes a security firm in 1960s London and begins working with young billionaire Thomas Wayne (Ben Aldridge), who has not yet become Bruce's father.

James Purefoy, Jason Flemyng, Edward Hogg, Jessye Romeo, Ramon Tikaram, and Harriet Slater were among the other cast members in Season 2.

Executive producer/writer Bruno Heller and executive producer/director Danny Cannon, as well as Matthew Patnick, produced Pennyworth for Gotham. The show is based on characters created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger for DC.</p>

            <h2> Wayne T. Carr shared a never-before-seen glimpse </h2>
            <p>.The hashtag #ReleaseTheGreenLanternScene is trending on Twitter as DC fans demand to see Wayne T. Carr in a scene that Warner Bros. forced Zack Snyder to remove from the film. It's no secret that the output of 2017's critically panned Justice League was rocky at best, and now we've heard that Zack Snyder's Justice League was no exception. In his or her latest film, Zack Snyder cast Wayne T. Carr as John Stewart."When I saw the full vision, I went through the journey like everybody went through the journey. Towards the end I realized, 'Ugh. I'm not a part of this. Darn,'" Carr added. "The thing that kind of just warmed my heart was once all of the concept art and stuff started to drop, it's been nothing but love from the fans, man. Like, I wasn't even in the movie, and I'm just getting positive feedback from people and support. It's super crazy. It's absolutely crazy, but I love it."
Snyder himself praised Carr's performance earlier this month, revealing the actor was referred to him by Justice League star Ray Fisher.</p>

            <h2> ‘New Gods,' directed by Ava DuVernay, and ‘The Trench,' directed by James Wan, are two DC films that are not moving forward at Warner Bros. (Exclusive). </h2>
            <p>The comic book characters developed by the late and legendary artist Jack Kirby would have been brought to the screen in New Gods, which DuVernay has been developing as a directing vehicle with celebrated comic book writer Tom King since 2018. DuVernay, on the other hand, has stayed with DC and is currently working on The CW's DC series Naomi. Meanwhile, The Trench was supposed to be a horror-tinged spinoff of Aquaman, focusing on a group of deadly amphibious creatures seen in the $1 billion-grossing 2018 film. The script was written by Noah Gardner and Aidan Fitzgerald, and Wan was creating it as a producer with collaborator Peter Safran. Wan is still staying with DC, as he prepares to film Aquaman 2 for the studio..</p>

            <h2>Warner Bros. is looking for a black director and an African-American actor to play Superman in the next film. </h2>
            <p>The next Superman film will be unlike anything else that has come before. In February, we heard that Warner Bros. had employed acclaimed author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates to write the screenplay for a new Superman film, which will be directed by J.J. Abrams. At the time, rumours circulated that this proposed film would feature a new Superman, a Black Superman. That is indeed what Warner Bros is doing, according to a new report from THR. The plan is to introduce the world to a Black Superman, and Warner Bros. has pledged to hire a Black director to direct the film, meaning Abrams will only be producing and not directing.</p>
